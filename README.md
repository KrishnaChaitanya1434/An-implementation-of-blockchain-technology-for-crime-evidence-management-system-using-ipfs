The project addresses the need for digitalizing crime evidence, emphasizing integrity in investigations. Tampering and unauthorized access prompt exploration of innovative solutions in the digital era. Traditional evidence handling is vulnerable, lacking traceability and efficiency. Concerns about authenticity and manual processes drive the need for secure, technological advancements in investigations. To tackle these challenges, we are embracing blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner across multiple nodes. Advantages of blockchain include decentralized, Enhanced security, transparency, data immutability, and resilience against failures. The project uses Ethereum's blockchain and smart contracts for secure, transparent evidence handling, ensuring a trustworthy, tamper-resistant environment in decentralized systems for crime evidence.
